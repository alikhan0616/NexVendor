# NexVendor

### A Scalable Multi-Vendor E-commerce Platform with Real-Time Features

## Introduction / Overview

**NexVendor** is a feature-rich e-commerce platform designed to allow multiple shop owners to sell products under a single storefront. It offers core features like **user-to-seller chat**, **product reviews**, **refund requests**, and **coupon discounts**, all managed via dedicated dashboards for **users**, **sellers**, and **admin**.

Unlike traditional single-store systems, NexVendor facilitates a **multi-seller ecosystem** with real-time interactions and full administrative oversight — enabling customers to shop from anyone, anywhere.

The project was developed **solo** as a capstone during the **DevWeekends Fellowship Program**, combining full-stack concepts into a production-ready system. It utilizes the **MERN stack**, **Socket.IO**, and **SMTP**, and is deployed using a **multi-server architecture**.

## Goals of the Project

Main objectives:

* Understand **role-based workflows** between customers, sellers, and admin
* Implement **real-time systems** for chat, product/events creation, and messaging
* Learn **secure authentication flows** using JWT and cookies
* Track key processes: **orders, revenue, coupons, refunds, and balances**
* Manage **frontend state** across dashboards
* Deploy a **scalable multi-server system** using modern DevOps tools

This project also aimed to consolidate learnings from older projects into one complete, documented build.

## Architecture Overview

NexVendor separates concerns across four layers:

* **Frontend**: Role-based dashboards using Vite + React
* **Backend API**: Modular Node/Express server with authentication
* **Real-Time Socket Server**: Built on Socket.IO
* **Database**: MongoDB with referenced schema relationships

### Frontend

* Built using **Vite + React.js**
* Routing managed via **React Router DOM**
* Route groups: Public, User, Seller, Admin (all protected)
* Dashboards are **role-specific** and modular
* **Tailwind CSS** for styling, **Axios** for API calls
* **Cookies** store tokens securely; **LocalStorage** used for cart/wishlist persistence

### Backend

* Built with **Node.js + Express.js**
* Organized folders: `controllers/`, `models/`, `middleware/`, `utils/`
* Auth: **JWT**, **SMTP email verification**
* Global error handlers: `ErrorHandler`, `AsyncErrorHandler`

### Database

* **MongoDB Atlas** with **Mongoose**
* Models: Users, Sellers, Products, Orders, Events, Coupons, Conversations, Messages, Withdrawals
* References via `userId`, `shopId`, nested objects

### Real-Time Layer

| Event Name          | Direction         | Purpose                           |
| ------------------- | ----------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `addUser`           | Client → Server   | Registers user socket             |
| `getUsers`          | Server → Clients  | Sends updated user list           |
| `sendMessage`       | Client → Server   | Sends message with optional image |
| `getMessage`        | Server → Receiver | Delivers message                  |
| `messageSeen`       | Client → Server   | Marks message seen and notifies   |
| `updateLastMessage` | Client → Server   | Updates chat preview              |
| `getLastMessage`    | Server → Clients  | Broadcasts last message           |
| `disconnect`        | Auto / Client     | Removes user socket mapping       |

## Tech Stack

### Frontend

* React.js, Vite, React Router DOM, Tailwind CSS
* Axios, Cookies, LocalStorage

### Backend

* Node.js, Express.js, dotenv, Cloudinary SDK, Stripe SDK
* JWT, SMTP, custom error middleware

**Note:** Multer was used early but replaced with Cloudinary

### Database

* MongoDB Atlas + Mongoose

### Real-Time Layer

* Socket.IO (dedicated Node.js server)

### Deployment

* Frontend on Vercel
* Backend and Socket.IO on Render
* Images via Cloudinary

## Challenges and Solutions

### Real-Time Messaging

**Challenge:** Managing sender/receiver sync and chat previews

**Solution:** Used `currentChat` and `lastMessage` states to synchronize views and message tracking

### Authentication Flow

**Challenge:** Secure activation and access control between dashboards

**Solution:** Used one-time SMTP email links and role-based routing guards

### Image Uploads

**Challenge:** Upload limits and payload errors with Multer

**Solution:** Migrated to Cloudinary with validation and size constraints

### State Updates

**Challenge:** UI didn’t reflect post-action changes (like delete, review)

**Solution:** Manual Redux dispatching and real-time state sync logic

### Deployment Errors

**Challenge:** Backend cookie issues and frontend route reloads

**Solution:** Moved backend to Render and added `vercel.json` routing fallback

## Best Practices

* Secure password hashing (bcrypt), JWT, HTTP-only cookies
* Role-protected routes (User, Seller, Admin)
* Modular code structure (routes/controllers/models/middleware)
* Central error handlers (`ErrorHandler`, `AsyncErrorHandler`)
* RESTful API conventions, meaningful endpoints
* Tailwind + responsive layout
* Postman for API testing, GitHub for version control

## Conclusion

NexVendor was more than a build — it was a full-stack journey. From role-based dashboards and payments to real-time chat, I learned how to architect, scale, and deploy a multi-service system.
